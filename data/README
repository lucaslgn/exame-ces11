This folder contains necesary informations and images for the game, please do not modify anything.
The map is separated in two files: map.jpg (the image of the map) and map.txt (text files that contains the tiles information).
The file map.txt is divided in three sections: the first line has the number of tiles, then, for each tile there is a line with two numbers: the x and y positions the tile. All lines after that have two numbers: they are the indexes of two tiles that are connected.
