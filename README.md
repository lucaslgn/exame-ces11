# Compilation

The project was developed with the possibilities of using CMake or just a Makefile to compile it. In order to do that, choose one of the possibilities and execute the command specified.

## Makefile

Type the command `make all` in the root of the project.

## CMake

Run the script `install.sh` with the command `./install.sh` in the root of the project.

P.S.: The CMakeLists.txt file was made only for the use of graphics, window and system modules. If the script doesn't have permission to be executed, run the command `chmod u+x install.sh`.

# Running

Run the binary `Exam` with the command `./Exam` or run the command `make run` in the root of the project.
